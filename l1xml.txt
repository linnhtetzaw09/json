=>XML (Extensible Markup Language)
Extensible = Extend our notation
Markup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own document

XML is not all the same HTML. But both are Markup Language.
XML is used to describe the data. HTML is used to display the data.
XML must define custom rules (tags) . HTML has pre-define rules (tags).

describe = XML designed to describe data and to focus on what data is
display = HTML was designed to display data and to focus on what data look

eg.element
<markup>Something Here</markup>

eg.attribute
<markup title="info">Something Here</markup>
